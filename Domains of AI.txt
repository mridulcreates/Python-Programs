# Introduction to AI
Definition of AI: AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn.
Examples of AI in everyday life: Virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri), recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube), and autonomous cars (Tesla)

# Domains of AI
AI can be broadly divided into three main domains:

A. Data Science
What is it? The study of data to extract meaningful insights using algorithms and statistical methods.
Applications:
Predictive analytics: Weather forecasting, stock market predictions.
Recommendation systems: Suggesting movies or products based on preferences.
Tools Used: Python, R, TensorFlow.

B. Computer Vision
What is it? Enabling machines to interpret and analyze visual data from the world (images, videos).
Applications:
Facial recognition (used in security systems).
Autonomous vehicles (detecting objects on the road).
Medical imaging (identifying diseases in X-rays).
Examples: Google Lens, object detection in cameras.

C. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
What is it? Enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human languages.
Applications:
Chatbots (customer service bots like ChatGPT).
Language translation (Google Translate).
Sentiment analysis (understanding emotions in text).
Examples: Siri, Alexa.
